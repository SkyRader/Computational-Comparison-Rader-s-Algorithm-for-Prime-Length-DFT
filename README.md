‚å®Ô∏è Instant Autocomplete Typing Tool (Flask & Datamuse)

A personalized, real-time writing assistant featuring intelligent autocompletion, context-aware suggestions, custom snippets, and user-controlled spellcheck integrated with a persistent personal dictionary.

‚ú® Features

This tool blends ultra-fast client-side lookups with robust server-side processing to deliver an uninterrupted typing experience.

Real-Time Autocomplete: Suggests completions based on prefixes (str -> string, structure).

Context-Aware Prediction: After typing a space, the tool suggests the next most relevant word based on the preceding context word.

User-Controlled Spellcheck: Right-click any misspelled or unrecognized word (red underline) to instantly bring up a custom menu showing spelling corrections.

Personalized Learned Dictionary:

Includes a "Add to Dictionary (Force Learn)" option on the spellcheck menu. Words are only added when explicitly instructed by the user, ensuring a clean, technical dictionary.

Learned words are prioritized and appear at the top of the suggestion list.

Custom Snippets: Expands common acronyms instantly (e.g., typing brb suggests be right back).

Customizable UI: Control the maximum number of suggestions and change the editor/suggestion font size, with preferences saved locally.

Asynchronous Performance: Uses AbortController to cancel slow network requests, ensuring only the latest, most relevant suggestions are displayed instantly.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

1. Backend Setup (app.py)

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/typing-tool.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/typing-tool.git)
cd typing-tool/


Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate


Install Requirements: (Requires flask and requests)

pip install flask requests


Run the Flask Server:

python app.py


The console will show the local IP address where the server is running (e.g., http://10.2.0.2:5000). Make a note of this IP.

2. Frontend Configuration (template/index.html)

The JavaScript file uses a hardcoded IP to connect to the Flask server.

Open template/index.html.

Find the FLASK_BASE_URL constant inside the <script> tag (around line 230).

Update the value to match the IP shown in your Flask console output (e.g., http://10.2.0.2:5000).

// In template/index.html
const FLASK_BASE_URL = 'http://YOUR_FLASK_IP:5000'; 


3. Launch the Application

Open the template/index.html file directly in your web browser. The front end will now connect to your running Flask server for suggestions.

üí° Usage
